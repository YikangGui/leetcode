Time Complexity: O(N * M); N = number of total quotes, M = maximum number of words in a quote (among all quotes)
----
- While creating toy_freq_quote dict, we go through all quotes and check each word of every quote.
    - This takes O(N * M) time

- While doing heapify operation, we will have at the most T number of elements in the list
    - Here, T = total number of toys.
    - This T value will be much less compared to N*M

- Heapify will take O(T) time
- After that we will perform heappop() for K times. Here K = number of topToys.
- Hence heappop will take O(K logT) for K elements

- So overall time is: O(N*M) + O(T) + O(K logT)
    - Now, K (topToys) â‰¤ T (totalToys)

- Therefore, time is: O(N*M) + O(T) + O(T logT)
    - As discussed above, T will be much less than M*N

- Hence, overall time complexity is O(N * M)


Space Complexity: O(T); T = total number of toys
----
- In case where each toy from the toys list is present in the quptes, toy_freq_quote will be of size O(T)
- Similarly, heap will also have T elements at the most
